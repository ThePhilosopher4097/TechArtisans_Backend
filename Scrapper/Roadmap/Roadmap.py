Choosing a technology on which you want to work depends on individuals,  requirements, and applications. Few technologies on which you can work and  are trending: A. MERN – The most popular and trending technology..-MongoDB – A NoSQL database that deals with data. -Express – A framework for NodeJS and handles GET, PUT, POST, DELETE functions. -React – A JavaScript library for building User Interfaces, building single-page applications. -NodeJS – An open-source server environment. B. MEAN – The major difference between MERN and MEAN is MERN  (written in JavaScript) works on React whereas MEAN deals with Angular  (a framework written in TypeScript). ",
  "Stage 2": "Frontend Development.Front-End is the UI (User Interface), it deals with the website’s overall appearance,  on how interactive and dynamic it is. For mastering it, get clear with all the  elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) – Start with the basic application of HTML  by creating a small website that includes all the elements. Play with tables, and  forms, and try adding images and links to the website to make it more eye-catching  which in return makes your work efficient. Click here to read about the conventions  and best practices of HTML.   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) – If you’re a person who loves creativity, you must  go through CSS. Using CSS, you can add colors to your website, give borders  to the headings or paragraphs, build the navigation bar, play with the icons,  font, and text, and many more things like that. Make the website responsive  i.e., how it looks on different screen sizes. The most popular CSS framework  used is Bootstrap. JavaScript – This is the programming language of the web. Learn about DOM  (Document Object Model), and API (Application Program Interface) properly. Frameworks – It is a platform for building software applications. It includes  programs, code libraries, and compilers which when brought together enable  the development of a project or system. These frameworks make components  reusable. Examples of frameworks are – React, Angular, Vue, etc. ",
  "Stage 3": "Backend development.The code that runs on the server, has logic to send the appropriate data from the client and receive it from the server. Also, it includes the database which stores all of the data of the application. It consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Here, the code written by developers transfers information from the database to the browser. Code written by back-end developers communicates information from the database to the browser. Skills you need to have to back-end developer: programming languages, frameworks, databases, servers, and API (Application Program Interface). Programming Languages – Back-end developers should know at least one of the programming languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript. JavaScript would be the best choice as this can be used in both the front-end and back-end. Frameworks – Frameworks are generally components or functions that are implemented to improve the performance of development. It includes the library of tools and modules that builds the architecture of a website. Several popular back-end frameworks are Express, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc. Database – Various DBMS technology should be known such as MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc. It handles with storage and management of data. Server – A system providing data, services, or programs is known as clients over a network. They share (send and receive) the data/information between client and server. API (Application Program Interface) – It is a set of defined rules that enables communication or acts as an intermediary between two applications. Request from the user is completed by the response from the server.",
  "Stage 4": "Database.The database is a collection of data from which we can manage data (store and retrieve). There are two types of databases: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL). Some popular databases are:  -MySQL – These are relational database management system, store and manages data. -MongoDB – It is a NoSQL database, Finds key-value DB, graph DBs -VoltDB – It follows a relational pattern, they use memory to store data.",
  "Stage 5": "Version Control System.When certain libraries are added to each application, it gets updated in a period which in turn creates a new version of it. Using Git is a very good practice if you’re working on applications. Git is an open-source platform where the entire code exists from the initial time. It is secure, flexible, easy to edit, and restores the code. It has repositories where all files including the codebase are saved and one can make changes according to the requirement. Anyone can collaborate and make changes accordingly. A list of Version Control Systems are:  -GitHub -GitLab -Beanstalk -Apache Subversion -Mercurial Benefits of Version Control: It helps you maintain code. You can re-use it whenever needed. Saves the changes made. Provides evidence of all changes made. Improves performance of the web development. Collaborate and contribute.",

  "Career Name": "Mobile Developer",
  "Stage 1": "Learn programming language.Software engineering requires you to learn a programming language, and in Android’s  case, there are two major programming languages used- Java and Kotlin. Learning  Kotlin is a good place to start because the language has been developed by Google  as a replacement for Java. It offers a host of features that ease the coding process.  With Kotlin, you can code with minimal chances of coding errors and crashes.  One of the reasons why programmers well-versed in Java also learn Kotlin is that,  besides offering extensive features, it is Java language compatible. With Kotlin,  you can use Kotlin codes on Java and the other way around. When getting acquainted with Kotlin, the three main aspects that should be the  focus of your learning are syntax and idioms, OOP (object-oriented programming),  and data structures and algorithms. Once you learn Kotlin, it sets the foundation for  subsequent steps to become an android developer.",
  "Stage 2": "Understand the Android Application Lifecycle.One of the biggest differences between writing an application for desktop and mobile  is that, while the operating system can manage the application on a desktop, you  code your mobile application for handling external events. This means you need to  design your application in a way that it interacts well with other applications on your  phone. For instance, your application should be programmed to work the ideal way  when the phone receives a text or a call. When you have this understanding, you can  create an app that offers the best user experience. ",
  "Stage 3": "Learn the Basics of an Android Platform.The Android platform has various components, and it is essential to know these  fundamental components and how to work with them to be proficient in developing  functional android apps. A well-planned android application development training  course will familiarize you with these basic components that help in handling the  configuration changes of the app, working with the components of the app, testing the  units, and following standardized practices for security and navigation. Once you know  about these elements of the android platform, you can use various tools to design the  app.",
  "Stage 4": "Get to Know the Android Tools.Every beginner android developer should be aware of the most significant tools for android development and the knowledge of using those tools. The first tool you need to get acquainted with is Android Studio, which is the official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for developing android apps. Integrated Development Environment is a software that brings together the most common tools used by developers in the form of a single graphical user interface. IDE is used for writing and testing software through different phases of development, such as building, coding, and testing. Android Studio helps enhance your productivity as it lowers the setup time while standardizing the process of development. You can write android apps for different devices like mobile phones, watches, TVs, etc., using Android Studio. Another tool you need when developing android apps is a Version Control System tool, preferably Git, which is used for coordination among developers, keeping track of changes in the codebase, and going back to the older versions when needed. One major advantage of learning to use Git is that it offers you the flexibility of handling both small and large-sized projects with efficiency and speed. Finally, you should be familiar with Gradle- a build automation tool which is part of the Android Studio. Gradle allows you to compile, build, and publish android applications.",
  "Stage 5": "Start With Small Projects.When you have a basic understanding of the android platform and common  tools useful for developing an application, contributing to open source is a  good way to put your knowledge to test and practice. However, make it a  point to start small as a beginner and make slow yet meaningful progress  to bigger projects. When you contribute to open source, you can interact  with your peers and the community, which can also bring opportunities  your way. You will find a range of projects on GitHub, which are generally open to  the public. These projects are of various types, such as bug fixing,  reviewing a project, and much more. You can open an issue and start  working on the project to master your coding and app development skills. ",
  "Stage 6": "Distribute Your Project.Once you work on small projects and come up with your own complete android app with the help of your knowledge and experience fixing various projects open to the public, the next big step is to distribute your android application and let it be known to the world. There are various ways through which you can do this, such as going to the official android market, having it on your website, or using a third-party website. If you plan to distribute your application through the official Android market, you need to register as an official Android developer and pay $25, which is a one-time fee.",

  "Career Name": "DevOps",
  "Stage 1": "Learn programming languages.Although DevOps engineers do not typically write source code, they do integrate  databases, debug code from the development team, and automate processes.  Automation is a critical part of what gives the DevOps lifecycle its speed, and a  DevOps engineer plays an important role in implementing a DevOps automation  strategy.Additionally, a DevOps engineer should have a working knowledge of the  languages their team is using to help them understand existing code, review new  code, and assist with debugging. Programming languages to learn include: -Go (recommended) -Ruby -Python -Node.js",
  "Stage 2": "Study operating systems.Operating systems (OSs) are a crucial piece of the technology stack that a DevOps  team needs to function. OSs, not only power the local machines that the team uses  to communicate and complete tasks, but it also runs the servers that host the team's  deployed applications.As such, you need to learn the command line terminal so you  are not reliant on the graphic user interface (GUI) to configure your servers.  Command line simplifies tasks that would require multiple clicks in a GUI, and  some commands are only executable through the terminal. Every OS is different,  so learning more than one is advisable. Popular OSs to learn include: -Linux (recommended) -Unix -Windows You'll also want to learn the larger strategies and rules that govern how OSs  are built and run. As a DevOps engineer, technical knowledge and conceptual  knowledge are equally important. OS concepts to learn include: -Process Management -Sockets -Threads and Concurrency",
  "Stage 3": "Review networking security and protocols.Any web-based application will use protocols to transfer and receive information from  the user. This means it is necessary to understand how protocols support different  request types.Just as important, you need to know the risks of these transfer methods  and how to secure them to prevent bad actors from intercepting your data or infiltrating  your application. Cybersecurity is a critical skill no matter your role within the DevOps  lifecycle. Networking protocols to learn include: -HTTP -HTTPS -SSL -SSH",
  "Stage 4": "Understand Infrastructure as Code.Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice for streamlining the provisioning of infrastructure to support your application deployment. Networks, servers, and other infrastructure are configured and managed using template files to create an environment with your application's exact requirements. IaC allows you to automate this process for faster deployments and updates..IaC strategies to learn include: -Containers -Configuration Management -Container Orchestration -Infrastructure Provisioning",
  "Stage 5": "Adopt Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment tools.Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a central principle  that DevOps is founded on: the integration of development and operations as  well as constant iterations. To achieve this philosophy, most DevOps teams turn  to tools built to support the DevOps lifecycle. CI/CD tools support multiple  phases of the pipeline and automate processes and handoffs to free up team  members. CI/CD tools to learn include: -GitHub -GitLab -Bamboo -Jenkins",
  "Stage 6": "Invest in application and infrastructure monitoring Monitoring is the practice of watching for signs of trouble in your application and its  underlying infrastructure so that your operations team can fix issues before they  turn into outages. This practice breaks down into two parts — application and  infrastructure. Application Monitoring Internal issues with your application can manifest in multiple ways, so it's best to  monitor multiple metrics.For example, a lower-than-normal conversion rate on a  form may be a sign that the form itself is malfunctioning when users try to sign up.  Ideally, your monitoring tools would flag errors generated within the code when  the signup request is sent as well as the conversion rate so you have multiple ways  to identify issues. Application monitoring tools to learn include: -Prometheus (recommended) -Nagios -Datadog -Infrastructure Monitoring Often, problems within your application's supporting infrastructure can have an equal impact  — if not greater than the application itself. For example, issues with your web application's cloud hosting can result in outages for  your users when they attempt to access it. Monitoring tools analyze errors generated  within your application's stack as well as performance metrics to flag errors early.  The sooner your team can respond, the less impact these issues will have on your user  experience. Infrastructure monitoring tools to learn include: -New Relic (recommended) -Jaeger -AppDynamics",
  "Stage 7": "Study cloud providers.Most — if not all — modern applications are hosted in the cloud. Cloud services  provide many benefits, including the cost savings and scalability that result  when you no longer need to host your own servers for your application. Naturally,  it's important to understand the different cloud services available and their unique  costs and benefits so you can select the best hosting provider for your finished  applications. Cloud providers to learn include: -AWS (recommended) -Azure -Google Cloud -Heroku",
  "Stage 8": "Learn cloud design patterns.Cloud design patterns are the philosophies that produce the scalability, reliability, and  security of cloud applications. Just as important as understanding cloud providers, you should also understand these patterns. There are many lessons to learn from cloud best practices (e.g. high latency) that you can apply to applications hosted in the cloud and to your development approach before deployment. For example, backing up your source code in a cloud-enabled repository so you don't lose access if your local storage is unavailable. Cloud design patterns to learn include: -Availability -Data Management -Design and Implementation Everything we have covered does not represent the full knowledge you will need to be -an effective DevOps engineer, but it does cover the core knowledge you should have before focusing on the finer details. You will find learning is much easier once you have this background to guide your research process. To close this post out, let's run through some key takeaways based on the different steps of the DevOps roadmap.",

  "Career Name": "Virtual & Augmented Reality",
  "Stage 1": "Understanding AR & VRBefore getting started, we must be able to understand the difference between virtual reality and augmented reality. Most people tend to confuse both terms and use them as interchangeably, but they’re very different from each other. A VR developer creates completely new digital environments that people can see through a device such as the Oculus headset, while an AR developer creates a layer of digital experience in our reality through the use of mobile apps, such as Pokemon Go, a game that utilizes this technology.",
  "Stage 2": "EducationSince there’s no VR or AR bachelor’s degree. People usually go for alternative education like coding bootcamps. They just need to know how to program software that drives AR/VR experiences. Having a bachelor’s degree in computer science is a plus when it comes to making a career as a VR and AR developer.",
  "Stage 3": "Requirements to become a AR/VR developer To become an AR/VR developer, you must be able to work with video game engines such as Unity or Unreal. These are two platforms that allow you to recreate environments in 3D. Besides, AR/VR developers must be able to understand programming languages such as C++, C#, JavaScript, or Swift. Some of the responsibilities you’ll have as a VR or AR engineer are to develop, maintain, and upgrade the software. When you get more experienced, you’ll be able to monitor what other developers are delivering.",
  "Stage 4": "Don’t forget about your soft skillsWhen working in a tech job, people usually focus only on their ability to code and develop software. One must remember that this is still a people-oriented job. Cultivating your soft skills will also help you land a job as a VR or AR engineer. Keep in mind that companies are usually looking for someone who is a problem solver, has logical thinking, and someone who is able to communicate well with other members of the team.",
  "Stage 5": "Industries that hire AR and VR engineersMedicine,Education, Travel and hospitality",
  "Stage 6": "Where to learn AR/VR developmentThere are great schools that can teach you AR or VR skills and help you kickstart your career.
